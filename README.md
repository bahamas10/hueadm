hueadm - Phillips Hue Admin CLI Utility
========================================

A command line management interface to [phillips hue](http://meethue.com)

Installation
------------
### Locally

First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), then:

    npm install -g hueadm

...and the executable will be installed globally as `hueadm`

### With Docker
After setting up docker [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), run:

    docker pull mmuffins/hueadm:latest

Getting Started
---------------

### Setup

#### Find a bridge

To get started you must find the IP address of the Hue bridge you would like to
manage.  If you know the IP address or the hostname of the bridge you would
like to manage you can skip this step.

    $ hueadm search
    IP
    10.0.1.80

On my network `10.0.1.80` is the IP of the bridge I'll be controlling.

#### Register a user

Now that we have the IP of the bridge we want to control, we can now create a
new account for the `hueadm` tool to use.

    $ hueadm -H 10.0.1.80 register dave
    sending request... press the link button on the hue bridge

Now, go to the bridge and press the physical button on it to complete the
registration - you'll see a message like this:

    $ hueadm -H 10.0.1.80 register dave
    sending request... press the link button on the hue bridge
    -
        success: {username: f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt}

That very long string is the username we'll be using for all requests going
forward.  Using the `lights` subcommand we can get a list of all lights on the
bridge to verify the new user account is working.

    $ hueadm -H 10.0.1.80 -U f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt lights
    ID  NAME                       STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    1   Nightstand                 on      254         true
    2   Garage Right               on      254         false
    3   Garage Left                on      254         false
    4   Pool House                 on      254         true
    5   Garage Side Door           on      254         true
    6   Garage Back                on      254         true
    7   Front Door                 on      254         true
    8   Screen Room Right          on      254         true
    12  Couch                      on      254         true
    13  Street Left                on      254         false
    14  Pool House Back            on      254         true
    15  Test Light 1               on      254         true
    16  Driveway                   on      254         false
    20  Inside Garage Front Left   off     250         false
    21  Inside Garage Front Right  off     250         true
    22  Inside Garage Back Right   off     250         false
    23  Inside Garage Back Left    off     2           false
    24  Screen Room Left           on      254         false
    25  Inside Screen Room Left    on      254         true
    26  Courtyard Back             on      254         false
    27  Front Yard                 on      254         false
    28  Hue color light 1          on      254         false

#### Create a config

Instead of passing `-H` and `-U` for every request, we can create a config file
for `hueadm` to use if those arguments are not specified.

    $ vim ~/.hueadm.json
    $ cat ~/.hueadm.json
    {
        "user": "f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt",
        "host": "10.0.1.80"
    }

### Docker Setup

#### Invoking Commands
Once the image has been pulled, all functions of the cli are avalable by passing the needed parameters to a new container

    $ docker run --rm mmuffins/hueadm -H 10.0.1.80 -U f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt lights
    ID  NAME                       STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    1   Nightstand                 on      254         true
    2   Garage Right               on      254         false
    ... snipped ...

#### Using a Config File
It is possible to provide a config file by mounting it as volume

    $ vim ~/.hueadm.json
    $ cat ~/.hueadm.json
    {
        "user": "f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt",
        "host": "10.0.1.80"
    }
    $ docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=${HOME}/.hueadm.json,target=/hueadm.json mmuffins/hueadm -c /hueadm.json lights
    ID  NAME                       STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    1   Nightstand                 on      254         true
    2   Garage Right               on      254         false
    ... snipped ...

#### Using aliases
To simplify the usage of the image, an alias can be set

    $ alias hueadm="docker run --rm -H 10.0.1.80 -U f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt"
    $ hueadm lights
    ID  NAME                       STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    1   Nightstand                 on      254         true
    2   Garage Right               on      254         false
    ... snipped ...

### Lights

#### Get light information

Now, we can run the same command like:

    $ hueadm lights
    ID  NAME                       STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    1   Nightstand                 on      254         true
    2   Garage Right               on      254         false
    ... snipped ...

To get information about a specific light:

    $ hueadm light 15
    state:
        on: true
        bri: 254
        hue: 14988
        sat: 141
        effect: none
        xy: [0.4575, 0.4101]
        ct: 366
        alert: select
        colormode: xy
        reachable: true
    type: 'Extended color light'
    name: 'Test Light 1'
    modelid: LCT001
    manufacturername: Philips
    uniqueid: 'removed'
    swversion: 5.50.1.19085

All subcommands allow for `-j` or `--json` to be specified to force the output
to be JSON.

    $ hueadm light -j 15
    {
      "state": {
        "on": true,
        "bri": 254,
        "hue": 14988,
        "sat": 141,
        "effect": "none",
        "xy": [
          0.4575,
          0.4101
        ],
        "ct": 366,
        "alert": "select",
        "colormode": "xy",
        "reachable": true
      },
      "type": "Extended color light",
      "name": "Test Light 1",
      "modelid": "LCT001",
      "manufacturername": "Philips",
      "uniqueid": "removed",
      "swversion": "5.50.1.19085"
    }

#### Setting light state

Using the same `light` subcommand, the state can be set.  There are a lot of
different ways to change the state of the lights.

- `on`: turn the light on
- `off`: turn the light off
- `clear`: clear any and all effects on a light
- `reset`: clear any and all effects on a light and set it to the "default" color (as if it just turned on)
- `select`: flash the light once
- `lselect`: flash the light for 15 seconds (can be cancelled with reset)
- `colorloop`: enable the color loop effect
- `[-+=]<num>`: set brightness, ie: `=50`, `-20`, `+40`, all values out of 254
- `[-+=]<num>%`: set brightness, ie: `=50%`, `-20%`, `+40%`, all values out of 100
- `-`: read state JSON object from stdin
- `[0-9]+K`: set the light to a color based on Kelvin. ie. `2700K`, `5000k`, etc.
- `<colorname>`: set the light to a color name (using CSS color names). ie. `blue`, `red`, `magenta`
- `#012345`: set the light to any hex string (`#` is optional)

Turn a light on or off

    $ hueadm light 15 off
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: false}
    $ hueadm light 15 on
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}

Again, `-j` works here too

    $ hueadm light 15 -j off
    [
      {
        "success": {
          "/lights/15/state/on": false
        }
      }
    ]

Set a light to green (this will turn it on if it was previously off)

    $ hueadm light 15 green
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/hue: 21845}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/sat: 254}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/bri: 64}

Any extra arguments will be processed as key=value pairs, and added to the
request sent to the bridge.  This way, it is possible to set multiple
attributes of a light in a single command.

Set the light to green with the brightness set to max.

    $ hueadm light 15 green bri=255
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/hue: 21845}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/sat: 254}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/bri: 254}

Change the light to red and take 5 seconds for the transition to happen.
`transitiontime` is given in 100's of milliseconds, so `50` is 5 seconds.

    $ hueadm light 15 red bri=127 transitiontime=50
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/transitiontime: 50}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/hue: 0}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/sat: 254}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/bri: 127}

Read light state from stdin as JSON.

    $ echo '{"on": true}' | hueadm light 15 -
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}

Set the light color using a hex string

    $ hueadm light 15 '#00ff00'
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/hue: 21845}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/sat: 254}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/bri: 127}

Set the light to a standard "Warm White" color (similar to an incandescent bulb)

    $ hueadm light 15 2700k
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/ct: 370}

Enable the color loop effect

    $ hueadm light 15 colorloop
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/effect: colorloop}

Clear the color loop (and any other) effect

    $ hueadm light 15 reset
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/on: true}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/alert: none}
    -
        success: {/lights/15/state/effect: none}

#### Modify a light

Using the `lights` subcommand, it is also possible to filter for a specific ID
to get a short synopsis of the light state.

    $ hueadm lights id=15
    ID  NAME          STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    15  Test Light 1  on      127         true

Rename the light to `foobar`

    $ hueadm rename-light 15 'foobar'
    -
        success: {/lights/15/name: foobar}

    $ hueadm lights id=15
    ID  NAME    STATUS  BRIGHTNESS  REACHABLE
    15  foobar  on      127         true

### Groups

#### List light groups

In order to control more than 1 light at a time, a group of lights must be
created.  The group can then be controlled the same way a single light is
controlled using `hueadm`.

To list all groups

    $ hueadm groups
    ID  NAME           TYPE  LIGHTS
    3   Garage Inside  Room  20,21,22,23
    4   Outside        Room  2,3,4,5,6,7,8,13,14,15,16,24,25,26,27

Even though it doesn't show it, group `0` always exists on the bridge and
contains every light known.  This group is special and cannot be deleted.

#### Create a light group

To create a light group

    $ hueadm create-group name='Test Group' lights=1,2,3,4
    -
        success: {id: '1'}

The group has been created with the id `1`, we can see it with

    $ hueadm group 1
    name: 'Test Group'
    lights:
        - '1'
        - '2'
        - '3'
        - '4'
    type: LightGroup
    state:
        all_on: true
        any_on: true
        recycle: false
    action:
        on: true
        bri: 254
        hue: 14988
        sat: 141
        effect: none
        xy: [0.4575, 0.4101]
        ct: 365
        alert: select
        colormode: xy

You may also specify a group using its name

    $ hueadm group 'Test Group'
    name: 'Test Group'
    lights:
        - '1'
        - '2'
        - '3'
        - '4'
    type: LightGroup
    state:
        all_on: true
        any_on: true
        recycle: false
    action:
        on: true
        bri: 254
        hue: 14988
        sat: 141
        effect: none
        xy: [0.4575, 0.4101]
        ct: 365
        alert: select
        colormode: xy

Or in a simpler way with

    $ hueadm groups id=1
    ID  NAME        TYPE        LIGHTS
    1   Test Group  LightGroup  1,2,3,4


#### Modify a group

Any property of the group can be modified with `modify-group`

To rename a group

    $ hueadm modify-group 1 name='Foo Group'
    -
        success: {/groups/1/name: 'Foo Group'}

    $ hueadm groups id=1
    ID  NAME       TYPE        LIGHTS
    1   Foo Group  LightGroup  1,2,3,4

To change the lights in a group

    $ hueadm modify-group 1 lights=5,6,7,8
    -
        success: {/groups/1/lights: ['5', '6', '7', '8']}

    $ hueadm groups id=1
    ID  NAME       TYPE        LIGHTS
    1   Foo Group  LightGroup  5,6,7,8

#### Set a group state

All state modifications to a single light can be used to modify a group as well

Kelvin

    $ hueadm group 1 2700k
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/on: true}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/ct: 370}

Color and brightness

    $ hueadm group 1 red bri=255
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/on: true}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/bri: 254}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/hue: 0}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/sat: 254}

Clear all effects

    $ hueadm group 1 reset
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/on: true}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/alert: none}
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/effect: none}

Groups also support recalling/loading of scenes. Either using

    $ hueadm group 1 scene=<sceneID>
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/scene: <sceneID>}

or

    $ hueadm recall-scene <sceneID> Garage
    -
        success: {/groups/1/action/scene: <sceneID>}

#### Delete a group

To delete the group run

    $ hueadm delete-group 1
    -
        success: '/groups/1 deleted'

### Users

#### List users

To list all users on a bridge (I've modified some IDs for privacy reasons)

    $ hueadm users
    ID                                        NAME               CREATION  LASTUSE

    name: 'hueadm#dave'

#### Delete a user

To delete our user

    $ hueadm delete-user f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt
    -
        success: '/config/whitelist/f28jfl3gtltQw4r4gKLEtVFsfJcBGE87A1RaAXgt deleted'

**NOTE:** If you do this, you will need to register a new username

### Misc.

#### Config

To get the full bridge config, use:

    $ hueadm config
    name: 'Philips hue'
    zigbeechannel: 20
    ... snipped ...

#### Raw request

To make a raw request to the bridge, use the `request` subcommand.  This will
automatically prepend `/api/<username>` to the endpoint given.

    $ hueadm request /lights/15
    state:
        on: true
        bri: 100
        hue: 14884
        sat: 144
        effect: none
        xy: [0.4597, 0.4103]
        ct: 370
        alert: none
        colormode: ct
        reachable: true
    type: 'Extended color light'
    name: foobar
    modelid: LCT001
    manufacturername: Philips
    uniqueid: 'removed'
    swversion: 5.50.1.19085

Give body as CLI args

    $ hueadm request -j -X PUT /lights/15/state on=true bri=255
    [
      {
        "success": {
          "/lights/15/state/on": true
        }
      },
